## Ngoc Linh Sammy Ha

An enthusiastic and driven individual who is able to rise up to challenges outside of her comfort zone. A keen learner with a desire for developing her programming and problem solving skills.

My thirst for knowledge lead me to teach myself basic HTML and CSS in my spare time which I found to be mentally stimulating. I decided programming would be the future for me and began my journey with Makers Academy.

## Interests
I enjoy keeping active and believe that it's important for both the body and the mind. I strength train religiously and love trying out new activities. I am part of London Fight Factory were I train in Brazilian Jujitsu. I have taken part in obstacles such as Rough Runner and have survived charity runs.

In my spare time I also enjoy reading crime novels, eating and socialising with my friends and family.

I have a passion for traveling and a sense of adventure. I have been fortunate to have backpacked many places across the world. I also spent three life changing months volunteering in Tanzania where I was able to experience a world that was completely outside of my comfort zone. I left Tanzania with a more positive and grateful attitude to life.
