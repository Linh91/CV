An enthusiastic and driven individual who is able to rise up to challenges outside of her comfort zone. A keen learner with a desire for developing her programming and problem solving skills.

My thirst for knowledge lead me to teach myself basic HTML and CSS in my spare time which I found to be mentally stimulating. I decided programming would be the future for me and began my journey with Makers Academy.

The next phase of this journey is to become a **Full-Stack Developer** with Test Driven Development and extreme programming values.

## Skills
#### Fast learner

I began Makers Academy with basic HTML and CSS knowledge and completed the course by successfully building a [command-line web browser](https://github.com/ffasolin/web-browser) as my final project and this was considered an almost impossible project to complete by my peers. As an intensive course, Makers Academy has shown me that I have the ability to pick up new technologies quickly and which saw me learning Ruby and JavaScript to a high level within a short space of time.

The ability to learn and pick up new things quickly has been apparent in my previous work experience. Having started as a Digital Assistant with no prior experience I was about to adapt and pick up new concepts and technologies quickly. Within a short space of time my role developed multiple responsibilities across different areas (Web development, Ad ops, Content editor).

I have no doubt that I will be able to bring this with me into my next role and I am confident that I will be able to get stuck in to whatever comes my way.

#### Teamwork

I believe good teamwork comes with positivity, support and good communication. Having worked in numerous high-pressured environment, I was able to stay open-minded and optimistic. I believe communication is key, the importance of this was apparent when working in group projects.  

Having experience a close knit team whilst volunteering in Tanzania, I developed a strong set of skills in working with others as a part of a team. I was able to develop this further within Makers which saw me working is various teams using the practices of extreme programming values.

#### Self motivated & driven

HTML and CSS were beneficial to my previous role as Digital Assistant, so I took it upon myself to teach myself basic coding in my spare time. I discovered my passion for programming, I found coding to be enjoyable and mentally stimulating. This lead me to pursue a career in development and join Makers Academy.

## Interests
I enjoy keeping active and believe that it's important for both the body and the mind. I strength train religiously and love trying out new activities. I am part of London Fight Factory were I train in Brazilian Jujitsu. I have taken part in obstacles such as Rough Runner and have survived charity runs.

In my spare time I also enjoy reading crime novels, eating and socialising with my friends and family.

I have a passion for traveling and a sense of adventure. I have been fortunate to have backpacked many places across the world. I also spent three life changing months volunteering in Tanzania where I was able to experience a world that was completely outside of my comfort zone. I left Tanzania with a more positive and grateful attitude to life.
