An enthusiastic and driven individual who is able to rise up to challenges outside of her comfort zone. A keen learner with a desire for developing her programming and problem solving skills.

My thirst for knowledge led me to teach myself basic HTML and CSS in my spare time which I found to be mentally stimulating. At this point, I decided programming would be the future for me and began my journey with Makers Academy.

The next phase of this journey is to become a **Full-Stack Developer** in an exciting environment where I can continue to learn and further my skills.

## Skills
#### Fast learner

I began Makers Academy with basic HTML and CSS knowledge and completed the course, successfully building a [command-line web browser](https://github.com/ffasolin/web-browser) as my final project which was considered an almost impossible project to complete by my peers. 

Makers Academy has shown me that I have the ability to pick up new technologies quickly and which saw me learning Ruby and JavaScript to a high level within a short space of time. This was also apparent in my previous job where I started as a Digital Assistant with no experience and within a short space of time my role developed with multiple responsibilities across different areas (Web development, Ad ops, Content editor) of the company.

#### Teamwork

I believe the key ingredients of good teamwork is positivity, support and good communication. For this reason, I strongly promote pair programming and extreme programming values.
 
Having worked in a close knit team in gruelling conditions (whilst volunteering in Tanzania), I was able to put into practise the above and as group, we built latrines for the community within the short deadline set and this is one of my proudest achievements to date.
 
I was able to put into use and develop this further with Makers which saw me working with various different people with different ability with success.

#### Self motivated & driven

I took it upon myself to learn basic coding in my spare time as I felt it would be beneficial to my job a Digital Assistant and it wasn’t long before I discovered my passion for programming. This lead me on the path to Makers Academy to pursue a career in web development. 
 
I find coding to be enjoyable and mentally stimulating and I am determined to make a successful career in it.

## Interests
I believe keeping active is important for both the body/mind and I strength train regularly. I am also part of the London Fight Factory where I train in Brazilian Jujitsu.

I have a passion for traveling and a sense of adventure. I have been fortunate to have backpacked across the world and have spent three life changing months volunteering in Tanzania. Here, I was able to experience a world that was completely outside of my comfort zone and left with a more positive and grateful attitude to life.
