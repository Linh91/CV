An enthusiastic and driven individual who is able to rise up to challenges outside of her comfort zone. A keen learner with a desire for developing her programming and problem solving skills.

My thirst for knowledge lead me to teach myself basic HTML and CSS in my spare time which I found to be mentally stimulating. I decided programming would be the future for me and began my journey with Makers Academy.

The next phase of this journey is to become a **Full-Stack Developer** with Test Driven Development and extreme programming values.

## Skills
#### Fast learner

began Makers Academy with basic HTML and CSS knowledge and completed the course by successfully building a command-line web browser as my final project – This was considered an almost impossible project to complete by my peers.  As an intensive course, Makers Academy has shown me that I have the ability to pick up new technologies quickly and saw me learning Ruby and JavaScript to a high level within a short space of time.

The ability to learn and pick up new skills quickly has also been apparent in my previous role where having initially joined as a Researcher, I was asked to cover the Digital Assistant role.  I quickly took to this role and was subsequently asked to join the team on a permanent basis.  Within a year I had further developed this role with multiple responsibilities and became an integral member of the team.

#### Teamwork

When I began my role as a Digital Assistant there was also another new member of the team, both of us had no prior experience within this role. With great supportive teamwork, effective communication and positive attitudes we were able to master our responsibilities and rebuild the team productivity.

During my time in Tanzania, I worked within a group of 15 people in a high pressure environment. With poor and difficult working conditions and short time scales we were able to work effectively together to build school latrines. This involved detailed planning and on going problem solving due to limited resources. I was selected as team leader to provide direction towards project goals  and to keep moral high given the work conditions.

#### Self motivated and driven

For our final project at Makers Academy, myself and my team decided to build a command-line web browser. We choose a technically challenging project with the sole aim of learning. We knew it would be difficult and having no knowledge of how a web browser worked, we put in time and dedication to ensure we were learning and developing new skills and understanding. We started the project with no understanding of how a browser worked and what it consist of to a working command-line browser. We pushed through to the end, working on weekends and gain immense knowledge of the web browser.

## Interests
I enjoy keeping active and believe that it's important for both the body and the mind. I strength train religiously and love trying out new activities. I am part of London Fight Factory were I train in Brazilian Jujitsu. I have taken part in obstacles such as Rough Runner and have survived charity runs.

In my spare time I also enjoy reading crime novels, eating and socialising with my friends and family.

I have a passion for traveling and a sense of adventure. I have been fortunate to have backpacked many places across the world. I also spent three life changing months volunteering in Tanzania where I was able to experience a world that was completely outside of my comfort zone. I left Tanzania with a more positive and grateful attitude to life.
