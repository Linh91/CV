## Interests
I enjoy keeping active and believe that it's important for both the body and the mind. I strength train religiously and love trying out new activities. I am part of London Fight Factory were I train in Brazilian Jujitsu. I have taken part in obstacles such as Rough Runner and have survived charity runs.

In my spare time I also enjoy reading crime novels, eating and socialising with my friends and family.

I have a passion for traveling and a sense of adventure. I have been fortunate to have backpacked across the world. I also spent three life changing months volunteering in Tanzania where I was able to experience a world that was completely outside of my comfort zone. I left Tanzania with a more positive and grateful attitude to life.
